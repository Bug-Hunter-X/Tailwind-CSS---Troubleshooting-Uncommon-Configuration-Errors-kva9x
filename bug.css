This error typically occurs when you have conflicting Tailwind directives or when the Tailwind configuration is not set up correctly.  For instance, using a class that doesn't exist in your `tailwind.config.js` file, or having a typo in a class name. Another common cause is forgetting to run `npm run build` (or the equivalent) after making changes to your `tailwind.config.js` file, causing Tailwind to not pick up the changes.  Incorrect purge configuration can also lead to classes being unexpectedly removed.
